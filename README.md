## About

This is a simple Python program that allows the user to calculate their interest on an investment or calculate the amount that should be
repaid on a home loan each month.
For this program I used variables, various data types and if-elif-else statements.

There are 2 calculators in this program. The user can select which option.

###### Investment Calculator
The user is prompted for the following information:
* The amount of money they are depositing

###### Home Loan Repayment Calculator

* The currrent property value
* The interest rate
